                    This is the very website that you are looking at! I needed a portfolio while job searching. I tried looking at templates
                    on sites such as Squarespace and there wasn't anything that was exactly what I wanted. Because of this, I thought it would be good to get some
                    HTML and CSS practice by making my own website. While it is not the prettiest website there has ever been, I have learned a lot while making it.

                I have tinkered with making websites before, but it was with frameworks such as Angular or Django, so this time I made it with
                pure HTML and CSS. This process was a good learning experience, but if I was to do this again, I would at least use some sort of framework
                so that I can do things like have a base template that new files are based on with things such as the navbar. With the way things
                are now, I have to copy and paste HTML to new pages and have to remember where are all the places I need to make tweaks so that everything
                is consistent.
