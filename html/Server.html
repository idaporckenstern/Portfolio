                    I had a friend show me how to use a Raspberry Pi to make a DNS server to make your network more private (and even block ads).
                    I wanted to give it a try, and ever since then I was hooked. The services that can be hosted on a home server are so helpful around
                    the house and help me save money by having services that would have a subscription otherwise. This has given me the added bonus of
                    becoming much more familiar with Unix and Bash.

                For my server, the distro I use is Proxmox, which makes creating virtual machines and LXC containers very simple and easy to manage. I have
                a Debian virtual machine that has my Docker containers set up. I have a container for Portainer on the virtual machine that makes it very simple to see the
                status of all the containers and manage them. While it is very nice to easily set up docker containers, however, whenever possible, I like to set up 
                my services in an LXC container where it is much easier to get into the containers to change all of the configs.

                    <h3>Mealie</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mealie is a really cool tool that allows you to digitalize any recipes you have with an easy to read UI. 
                        It also allows you to take recipes online and to import them into Mealie. This lets you have a one stop shop
                        for all of your favorite recipes and has been a game changer for me and my wife.

                    <h3>Nextcloud</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have recently taken up wildlife photography and I need a place to store all of my photographs. I tried Google Drive,
                        but a 24 megapixel camera fills up Google Drive's memory very quickly. Nextcloud lets me utilize the 16 terabytes of storage
                        on my server and gives me access to my photos wherever I am. Setting Nextcloud up in an LXC container took a lot of work, but getting it working was worth the effort.

                    <h3>Grocy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Grocy is a one stop shop for all things groceries. The service has a ton of features from keeping inventory of groceries
                        to a chore chart to tracking battery charge. We mostly use it as a grocery list. I love being able to add items and have it
                        automatically sort into each custom category that we made, making back tracking at the store much less common.
