                <p>
                    When I was teaching I really hated creating seating charts. This inspired me to make a seating chart generator
                    where I could create a new seating chart with all the student names on an image with their names on their seats at
                    the touch of a button.

                I used python with tKinter to create the GUI and mysql to store the students and their seats. 
                I wanted it to be as generic as possible so I could move seats or classes and still be able to use this code.
                I put an image that has the classroom layout and the ability to move the seat icons to where they belong. The students can
                be organized alphabetically or randomly. Then they can be dragged and dropped to whatever seat. If there is already a student there
                they will switch seats. I added the ability to add students by clicking the add student button, and drop students by dragging them
                onto the drop section at the top of the page. No changes are permanent until the save button is pressed.

                This is the first big functional coding project that I have done. There was a lot that I learned on the way and because of this there is a lot
                I would change if I were to do this from scratch. The biggest thing I would change is organization. I would use OOP better to make the code more   
                modular and easier to understand. Such as having a class that is in charge of all the GUI functionality and another that is in charge of all the database
                functionality. As it stands it is much more jumbled and difficult to debug.
