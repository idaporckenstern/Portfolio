                    When I was teaching, I really hated creating seating charts. This inspired me to make a seating chart generator.
                    The goal was to have a picture of the layout of the classroom, then at the press of a button, have all of
                    the students' names appear on their seat in the image of the classroom layout.

            <p class="subtitle">
                I used Python with Tkinter to create the GUI and MySQL to store the student names and their seats. 
                I wanted it to be as generic as possible so I could move seats or classes and still be able to use this code.
                I put an image that has the classroom layout and the ability to move the seat icons to where they belong. The students can
                be organized alphabetically or randomly and can then be dragged and dropped to whatever seat. If there is already a student in that seat,
                the program will change the student in that seat. I added the ability to add students by clicking the "add student" button, and drop students by dragging them
                onto the "drop student" section at the top of the page. No changes are permanent until the save button is clicked.

            <p class="subtitle">
                This is the first big functional coding project that I have done. There was a lot that I learned on the way, and because of this, there is a lot
                I would change if I were to do this from scratch. The biggest thing I would change is organization. I would use OOP more effectively to make the code more   
                modular and easier to understand. For example, I'd have a class that is in charge of all the GUI functionality and a seperate one in charge of all the database
                functionality. As it stands, the code is much more jumbled and difficult to debug.
