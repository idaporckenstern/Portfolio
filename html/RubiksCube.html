                    I had been looking for a project, and I saw a Rubiks Cube Solver online that I thought was really
                    cool and I decided to give it a try. I am still at the very early stages in this project so there is 
                    still a lot to do.

            <p class="subtitle">
                In order to save in costs, I am using servos to turn the Rubiks cube. My goal is to automate the entire process by having a 
                camera read the colors on the cube in order to solve it. I am using OpenCV to read the colors and give the input to the 
                Kociemba algorithm. This then gives a solution that is at most 20 turns. I have made the code to detect the colors and I am
                currently designing the chassis to hold the camera, cube, and servos.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title">To Do</h3>
            <p class="subtitle">
                Once I have a chassis, I need to calibrate the OpenCV code to properly store the color configuration so it can be plugged into 
                the solver. I still haven't decided if I am going to have a servo at each face or if I will just use four and rotate the cube
                to get the bottom and the top. The biggest issue I am running into design wise is how I can have the camera read the imput without
                being blocked by the arms. My current plan is to have two concentric pipes that will make a rack and pinion gear with the inner pipe being
                the rack. A pinion is on the outside that raises the inner pipe up and down. The cube gets raised up to the camera to show a face, then 
                switches sides and shows the camera again.
